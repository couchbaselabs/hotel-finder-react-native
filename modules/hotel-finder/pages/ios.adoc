In this tutorial, you will learn how to use Couchbase Lite in a React Native project.

The sample project is an application that allows users to search and bookmark hotels from a Couchbase Lite database.
The application contains 2 screens:

- *Bookmarks Screen:* to list the bookmarked hotels. You can unbookmark a previously bookmarked hotel from this screen
- *Search Screen:* to search for hotels by providing a country and/or full-text search query. You can bookmark (or unbookmark) a hotel from this screen.

== Pre-requisites

This tutorial requires the following components and versions to run successfully.

* Xcode 10 or above
* Swift 4.2
* Couchbase Lite 2.1.1

The tutorial also assumes that the reader has a basic understanding of developing apps with React Native and Swift

== Getting Started

*The User Interface has already been implemented in the starter project.
You will add the code to persist and query data.*

. Download the link:{attachmentsdir}/starter-project.zip[starter project].
. Unzip *starter-project.zip*.
. Open the *starter-project/HotelFinder/* directory in the JavaScript editor of your choice (for example, https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code] or https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/[WebStorm]).
. The User Interface code is located in *ui/Bookmarks.js* and *ui/Search.js*.
. Run the following commands in your Terminal.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd HotelFinder
npm install -g react-native-cli
npm install
react-native link
----
The `react-native link` command bundles native dependencies in your Xcode project.
It is required in the https://react-native-training.github.io/react-native-elements/docs/0.19.0/getting_started.html[react-native-elements] installation process.
. Start the React Native development server.
+
[source,bash]
----
npm run start
----
The `npm run start` command starts a web server that bundles and serves the JavaScript code to the application.
You should see the following in the output.
+
[source,bash]
----
Metro Bundler ready.

Loading dependency graph...
----
. Open the Xcode project at *HotelFinder/ios/HotelFinder.xcodeproj*.
. Build and run.
. You can click on the *Hotels* button to run a search query.
The result of the query will be empty.

In the next section, you will setup the Native Module interface which is the first step for establishing communication between native code and JavaScript.

== Native Modules Setup

With https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-modules-ios[Native Modules], you can write native code and have access to it from JavaScript.
It is helpful when an app needs access to native APIs, and React Native doesn't have a corresponding module yet.
In this tutorial, you will use the Native Modules API to implement methods in Swift and call them from the JavaScript code.
These methods will do the following:

- Full Text Search for terms in a Couchbase Lite database.
- Query documents in a Couchbase Lite database.
- Create and Update documents in a Couchbase Lite database.

=== Swift/Objective-C Setup

. Select the kbd:[File > New > File... > Objective-C File] menu and create a new file called *HotelFinder-RCTBridge.m*. This file defines the methods that exported to the JS layer.
. Insert the following in *HotelFinder-RCTBridge.m*.
+
[source,swift]
----
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
#import "React/RCTBridgeModule.h"

@interface RCT_EXTERN_MODULE(HotelFinderNative, NSObject)

/* code will be added here later. */

+ (BOOL)requiresMainQueueSetup
{
  return YES;
}
@end
----
. Select the kbd:[File > New > File... > Objective-C File] menu and create a new file called *HotelFinderNative.swift*. This file contains the native implementation of the APIs that are exported to the JS layer.
. Insert the following in *HotelFinderNative.swift*.
+
[source,swift]
----
import Foundation

@objc (HotelFinderNative)
class HotelFinderNative: NSObject {

	/* code will be added here later. */

}
----

You are now ready to implement functionalities in Swift.
The next step is to import the Couchbase Lite framework in your project.

== Couchbase Lite Setup

. Download Couchbase Lite from https://www.couchbase.com/downloads[here].
. Unzip the file and drag *CouchbaseLiteSwift.framework* to the *Frameworks* folder in the Xcode project navigator.
+
image::drag-framework.png[]
. Navigate to *Project > General > Embedded Binary* and drag *CouchbaseLiteSwift.framework* over the list.
+
image::drag-embedded.png[]
. Import the Swift framework in *HotelFinderNative.swift*.
+
[source,swift]
----
import CouchbaseLiteSwift
----

== Database Setup

In our example, we will start with a pre-built Couchbase Lite database that contains a bunch of hotel documents.
We will make our queries against the documents in this database.
Note that in a real world application, the data could be synced down from other Couchbase Lite clients or from Sync Gateway in the cloud.

The pre-built database needs to be added to the Xcode project.

. Download link:{attachmentsdir}/travel-sample.cblite2.zip[travel-sample.cblite2.zip] and drag it over the Xcode project navigator.
Be sure to select the *Copy items if needed* checkbox.
. You will use the singleton pattern to setup the database instance.
Create a new file named *DatabaseManager.swift* and insert the following.
+
In this code, you first check if a database named "travel-sample" exists.
If it doesn't exist, the bundled database file is copied to the default Couchbase Lite directory.
The database is then opened and the instance is set.
The `createIndex` method creates the Full-Text Search index on the `description` property.
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/{database-manager}[tag=setup-database,indent=0]
----
. Next, add the following properties in *HotelFinderNative.swift*.
+
[source,swift]
----
let database = DatabaseManager.sharedInstance().database
let DOC_TYPE = "bookmarkedhotels"
----
This code adds the database as an instance property on the `HotelFinderNative` class.
. Build & run. The project should build successfully.

In the next sections, you will use this instance variable to perform various operations.

== Search Hotels

In this section, you will add the functionality to search for hotels.

. First, we import the appropriate ReactNative module. For this, add the following to the top of *HotelFinder/ui/Search.js*.
+
[source,javascript]
----
include::{examplesdir}/HotelFinder/ui/Search.js[tag=import,indent=0]
----
The `HotelFinderNative` constant corresponds to the native module that was created in the <<swift-objective-c-setup,Swift/Objective-C Setup>> section.
. Next, you must implement a method in the `HotelFinderNative` module before it can be accessed in JavaScript.
Insert a new method signature in *HotelFinder-RCTBridge.m*.
+
[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/{hotel-finder-bridge}[tag=search,indent=0]
----
`RCT_EXTERN_METHOD()` is a React Native macro to specify that this method must be exported to JavaScript.
. Implement this method in *HotelFinderNative.swift*.
+
This code creates the Full-text search query using the `match()` operator.
+
In this particular example, the match expression looks for the `descriptionText` value in the `description` property.
This match expression is logically ANDed with an `equalTo` comparison expression which looks for the `locationText` value in the `country`, `city`, `state` or `address` properties.This expression is then used in the `where` clause of the query in the usual way.
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/{hotel-finder-native}[tag=search,indent=0]
----
. You can call the `search` swift method from *Search.js*. For this, add the following text to the `onChangeText` method in *Search.js*.
+
[source,javascript]
----
include::{examplesdir}/HotelFinder/ui/Search.js[tag=search,indent=0]
----
. Build & run.
. Tap on "Hotels" button to get to the "Search" screen.
. In search screen. enter "UK" in the _Country_ input field and press the *Lookup* button.
You should now see a list of hotels in the search result.
+

== Bookmark Hotel

. Bookmarked hotel IDs are persisted in a separate document of type `bookmarkedhotels`.
+
The first time a hotel is bookmarked, the `bookmarkedhotels` document is created.
Subsequently, every time a new hotel is bookmarked, the hotel ID is appended to the `hotels` array of the existing document.
You will add a method to find or create the document of type `bookmarkedhotels`.
Add the following `findOrCreateBookmarkDocument` method in *HotelFinderNative.swift*.
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/{hotel-finder-native}[tag=find-or-create,indent=0]
----
. You will now add the method to update the document when a hotel is bookmarked.
Insert a new method signature in *HotelFinder-RCTBridge.m*.
+
[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/{hotel-finder-bridge}[tag=bookmark,indent=0]
----
. Implement the corresponding method natively in *HotelFinderNative.swift*.
Every time a new hotel is bookmarked, the hotel ID is appended to the `hotels` array and the update is saved to the database.
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/{hotel-finder-native}[tag=bookmark,indent=0]
----
. You can now call it from *Search.js*. Add the following to the `bookmark` method in *Search.js*
+
[source,javascript]
----
include::{examplesdir}/HotelFinder/ui/Search.js[tag=bookmark,indent=0]
----
. While searching for hotels, the app should also display an icon on hotels that are previously bookmarked .
To do so, you will add a new method to query hotel Ids.
Insert a new method signature in *HotelFinder-RCTBridge.m*.
+
[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/{hotel-finder-bridge}[tag=query-ids,indent=0]
----
. Implement the corresponding method natively in *HotelFinderNative.swift*.
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/{hotel-finder-native}[tag=query-ids,indent=0]
----
. You can now call `queryBookmarkIds` java method from *Search.js*. For that, add the following to the `queryBookmarkIds` method in *Search.js*
+
[source,javascript]
----
include::{examplesdir}/HotelFinder/ui/Search.js[tag=query-ids,indent=0]
----
. Build & run.
. Click *Hotels* and search for a hotel (type "UK" in the country field for example).
. You can now swipe a table view row to bookmark a hotel.
The bookmark icon is displayed.
+
image::swipe-row.gif[]

In the next section, you will query the bookmarked hotels to display them on the _Bookmarks_ screen.

== List Bookmarks

. Insert a new method signature in *HotelFinder-RCTBridge.m*.
+
[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/{hotel-finder-bridge}[tag=query-bookmarks,indent=0]
----
. Implement the corresponding method natively in *HotelFinderNative.swift*.
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/{hotel-finder-native}[tag=query-bookmarks,indent=0]
----
To query bookmark documents, you will write a JOIN query between the document of type `bookmarkedhotels` which contains hotel Ids and documents of type `hotels` which contain all the other fields (`name`, `address`, `phone` etc.)
. On the JavaScript side, you must first import the `HotelFinderNative` ReactNative module.
Add the following to the top of *HotelFinder/ui/Bookmarks.js*.
+
[source,javascript]
----
include::{examplesdir}/HotelFinder/ui/Bookmarks.js[tag=import,indent=0]
----
You can now call the `queryBookmarkDocuments` native method from *Bookmarks.js*. Add the following text to the `queryBookmarkDocuments` method in *Bookmarks.js*.
+
[source,javascript]
----
include::{examplesdir}/HotelFinder/ui/Bookmarks.js[tag=query-bookmarks,indent=0]
----
. Build and run.
. You should now see the hotel that was bookmarked in the <<bookmark-hotel, Bookmark Hotel>> section listed in the _bookmarks_ screen.
+

By now, the pattern should seem very familiar and essentially consists of the following steps:

- Declare the method to be exported in *HotelFinder-RCTBridge.m*
- Implement the method natively in *HotelFinderNative.swift*.
This layer will interact with the native iOS implementation of Couchbase Lite for data persistence functions.
- Invoke the exported method from JavaScript (you will have to import the React Native module the very first time).

== Conclusion

*Well done!* You have learned how to import Couchbase Lite in a React Native project, and how to add search and persistence functionalities to your application!

As an exercise, you can follow the same procedure to implement the functionality to:

- Unbookmark a hotel on the Bookmarks screen.
- Unbookmark a hotel on the Search screen.

You can find a working copy of the *completed project* in the link:{attachmentsdir}/final-project.zip[final project] zip file. Follow the instructions in the *Couchbase Lite Setup* section to integrate Couchbase Lite into your final project. To build and run the final project, follow the steps in the *Getting Started* section. 
The final project also implements the missing functionalities mentioned above.
