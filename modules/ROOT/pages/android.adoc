In this tutorial, you will learn how to use Couchbase Lite in a React Native project.

The sample project is an application that can search for hotels.
Each hotel can be bookmarked or unbookmarked.

In this application, the User Interface is written in JavaScript and Data Persistence is written in Swift with Couchbase Lite's API.
This architecture allows you to write the User Interface code once for both iOS and Android whilst keeping the benefits of using Couchbase Lite for data management.

== Pre-requisites

This tutorial requires the following components and versions to run successfully.

* Android Studio 3.1.3 or above
* Android SDK 19
* Java 8
* Couchbase Lite 2.1.1
* Node.js 6.0 or above

The tutorial also assumes that the reader has a basic understanding of developing apps with React Native and Java.

== How to Complete this Tutorial

*The User Interface has already been implemented in the starter project.
You will add the code to persist and query data.*

. Download the link:{attachmentsdir}/starter-project.zip[starter project].
. Unzip *starter-project.zip*.
. Open the *starter-project/HotelFinder/* directory in the JavaScript editor of your choice (for example, https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code] or https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/[WebStorm]).
. The User Interface code is located in *ui/BookmarkedHotels.js* and *ui/Hotels.js*.
. Run the following commands in your Terminal.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd HotelFinder
npm install -g react-native-cli
npm install
react-native link
----
The `react-native link` command bundles native dependencies in your Xcode project.
It is required in the https://react-native-training.github.io/react-native-elements/docs/0.19.0/getting_started.html[react-native-elements] installation process.
. Start the React Native development server.
+
[source,bash]
----
npm run start
----
The `npm run start` command starts a web server that bundles and serves the JavaScript code to the application.
You should see the following in the output.
+
[source,bash]
----
Metro Bundler ready.

Loading dependency graph...
----
. Open the Xcode project at *HotelFinder/ios/HotelFinder.xcodeproj*.
. Build and run.
. You can click on the *Hotels* button to run a search query.
But the result of the query is empty because the application is missing the code to persist data.

In the next section, you will setup the Native Module interface which is the first step for establishing communication between native code and JavaScript.

== Native Modules Setup

With https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-modules-android[Native Modules], you can write native code and have access to it from JavaScript.
It is helpful when an app needs access to native APIs, and React Native doesn't have a corresponding module yet.
In this tutorial, you will use the Native Modules API to implement methods in Java and call them from the JavaScript code.
These methods will do the following:

- Search for terms in a Couchbase Lite database.
- Query documents in a Couchbase Lite database.
- Create and Update documents in a Couchbase Lite database.

=== Java Setup

. Create a new file named *HotelFinderNative.java* in *app/src/main/java/com/hotelfinder/* with the following.
+
[source,java]
----
public class HotelFinderNative extends ReactContextBaseJavaModule {

    private static String DB_NAME = "travel-sample";

    HotelFinderNative(ReactApplicationContext reactContext) {
        super(reactContext);
    }

    @Override
    public String getName() {
        return "HotelFinderNative";
    }

}
----
. Create a new file named *HotelFinderPackage.java* in *app/src/main/java/com/hotelfinder/* with the following.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/{hotel-finder-package}[tag=hotel-finder-package,indent=0]
----
. The package needs to be provided in the `getPackages` method of the *MainApplication.java* file.
+
[source,java]
----
protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
	return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
			new VectorIconsPackage(),
			new HotelFinderPackage() // <-- Add this line with your package name.
	);
}
----

You are now ready to implement functionalities in Java.
The next step is to import the Couchbase Lite framework in your project.

== Couchbase Lite Setup

. Add the following in the `dependencies` section of the applicationâ€™s *build.gradle* (the one in the *app* folder).
+
[source,java]
----
implementation 'com.couchbase.lite:couchbase-lite-android:2.1.0'
----

== Database Setup

In our example, we will start with a pre-built Couchbase Lite database that contains a bunch of hotel documents.
We will make our queries against the documents in this database.
Note that in a real world application, the data could be synced down from other Couchbase Lite clients or from Sync Gateway in the cloud.

The pre-built database needs to be added to the Android Studio project.

. Download link:{attachmentsdir}/travel-sample.cblite2.zip[travel-sample.cblite2.zip] and drag it over the Xcode project navigator.
Make sure to select the *Copy items if needed* checkbox.
. Add a new instance variable of type `Database` in *HotelFinderNative.java*.
+
[source,java]
----
private Database database;
----
. Add the following method in *HotelFinderNative.java* and call it from the class constructor.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/{hotel-finder-native}[tag=setup-database,indent=0]
----
In this code, you first check if a database named "travel-sample" exists.
If it doesn't exist, the bundled database file is copied to the default Couchbase Lite directory.
The database is then opened and the instance returned.
. In *HotelFinderNative.swift*, add the following method.
This method creates the Full-Text Search index on the `description` property.
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/{hotel-finder-native}[tag=create-index,indent=0]
----
. Build & run. The project should build successfully.

In the next sections, you will use this instance variable to perform various operations.

== Search Hotels

In this section, you will add the functionality to search for hotels.

. Add the following to the top of *HotelFinder/ui/Hotels.js*.
+
[source,javascript]
----
include::{examplesdir}/HotelFinder/ui/Hotels.js[tag=import-statement,indent=0]
----
The `HotelFinderNative` constant corresponds to the native module that was created in the <<swift-objective-c-setup,Swift/Objective-C Setup>> section.
. Next, you must implement the new method in the `HotelFinderNative` module before it can be accessed in JavaScript.
Insert a new method signature in *HotelFinder-RCTBridge.m*.
+
[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/{hotel-finder-native}[tag=search,indent=0]
----
`RCT_EXTERN_METHOD()` is a React Native macro to specify that this method must be exported to JavaScript.
. Implement this method in *HotelFinderNative.swift*.
This code creates the FTS query using the `match()` operator.
In this particular example, the match expression looks for the `descriptionText` value in the `description` property.
This match expression is logically ANDed with an `equalTo` comparison expression which looks for the `locationText` value in the `country`, `city`, `state` or `address` properties.
This expression is then used in the `where` clause of the query in the usual way.
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/HotelFinder/ios/HotelFinder/HotelFinderNative.swift[tag=search-hotels-method-impl,indent=0]
----
. Add the following to the `onChangeText` method in *Hotels.js*.
+
[source,javascript]
----
include::{examplesdir}/HotelFinder/ui/Hotels.js[tag=search-hotels-js,indent=0]
----
. Build & run.
. Enter "UK" in the location input field and press the *Lookup* button.
You should now see a list of hotels in the search result.
+

== Bookmark Hotel

. Insert a new method signature in *HotelFinder-RCTBridge.m*.
+
[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/HotelFinder/ios/HotelFinder/HotelFinder-RCTBridge.m[tag=bookmark-method-signature,indent=0]
----
. Implement the corresponding method natively in *HotelFinderNative.swift*.
Bookmarked hotels are persisted in a separate document with a type of `bookmarkedhotels`.
The first time a hotel is bookmarked, the `bookmarkedhotels` document is created with the document ID of that hotel document in the `hotels` property.
The hotel's information is persisted in a separate hotels type document.
Subsequently, every time a new hotel is bookmarked, the hotel ID is appended to the `hotels` array of the existing document.
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/HotelFinder/ios/HotelFinder/HotelFinderNative.swift[tag=bookmark-method-swift,indent=0]
----
. Next, add the `fetchBookmarkDocument` method which gets called from the `bookmarkHotel` method.
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/HotelFinder/ios/HotelFinder/HotelFinderNative.swift[tag=fetch-bookmark-document,indent=0]
----
. Add the following to the `bookmarkHotel` method in *Hotel.js*.
+
[source,javascript]
----
include::{examplesdir}/HotelFinder/ui/Hotels.js[tag=bookmark-method-js,indent=0]
----
. Build & run.
. Click *Hotels* and search for a hotel (type "UK" in the location field for example).
. You can now swipe a table view row to bookmark a hotel.
The bookmark icon is displayed.
+
image::swipe-row.gif[]

In the next section, you will query the bookmarked hotels to display them on the first screen.

== Bookmarked Hotels List

. Add the following to the top of *HotelFinder/ui/BookmarkedHotels.js*.
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/HotelFinder/ui/BookmarkedHotels.js[tag=import-statement,indent=0]
----
. Insert a new method signature in *HotelFinder-RCTBridge.m*.
+
[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/HotelFinder/ios/HotelFinder/HotelFinder-RCTBridge.m[tag=bookmark-list-signature,indent=0]
----
. Implement the corresponding method natively in *HotelFinderNative.swift*.
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/HotelFinder/ios/HotelFinder/HotelFinderNative.swift[tag=bookmark-list-method-swift,indent=0]
----
. Add the following to the `queryBookmarkedHotels` method in *BookmarkedHotels.js*.
+
[source,javascript]
----
include::{examplesdir}/HotelFinder/ui/BookmarkedHotels.js[tag=bookmark-list-method-js,indent=0]
----
. Build and run.
. You can now see the hotel that was bookmarked in the <<bookmark-hotel, Bookmark Hotel>> section show up on the Bookmarked hotels screen.
+

////
== Unbookmark Hotel

. Insert a new method signature in `HotelFinder-RCTBridge.m`.
+
[source,objectivec]
----
include::{examplesdir}/HotelFinder/ios/HotelFinder/HotelFinder-RCTBridge.m[tag=unbookmark-method-signature,indent=0]
----
. Implement this method in `HotelFinderNative.swift`.
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/HotelFinder/ios/HotelFinder/HotelFinderNative.swift[tag=unbookmark-method-swift,indent=0]
----
. Add the following to the `unbookmarkHotel` method in *Hotels.js*.
+
[source,javascript]
----
include::{examplesdir}/HotelFinder/Hotels.js[tag=unbookmark-method-js,indent=0]
----
