In this tutorial, you will learn how to use Couchbase Lite in a React Native project.

The sample project is an application that allows users to search and bookmark hotels from a Couchbase Lite database.
The application contains 2 screens:

- *Bookmarks Screen:* to list the bookmarked hotels. You can unbookmark a previously bookmarked hotel from this screen
- *Search Screen:* to search for hotels by providing a location and/or full-text search query. You can bookmark (or unbookmark) a hotel from this screen.

== Architecture

The user Interface is written in JavaScript while the business logic and data model is written in native Java.
The data model uses Couchbase Lite as the embedded data persistence layer.
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-modules-android[React Native module] acts as the bridging layer between the JavaScript layer and the native Java layer.

This architecture allows you to write the User Interface code once for both iOS and Android apps while leveraging Couchbase Lite's native Android framework for data management. 

image::arch-android.jpg[]

== Data Model

The data model for the app is very straightforward.
There are two types of documents:

- The _"bookmarkedhotels"_ document which includes the list of Ids corresponding to the hotels that have been bookmarked
- The _"hotel"_ document which contains the details of the bookmarked hotel. The bookmarkedhotels document references the hotel document.

Note that although we have modeled our data using a "by Reference" /normalized model, since Couchbase Lite is JSON Document store, you have the flexibility to embed the details of the hotels within the _bookmarkedhotels_ hotels. 

== Pre-requisites

This tutorial requires the following components and versions to run successfully.

* Android Studio 3.0 or above
* Android SDK 19 or above
* Couchbase Lite 2.1.1

The tutorial also assumes that the reader has a basic understanding of developing apps with React Native and Java.

== Tutorial Walkthrough

*The User Interface has already been implemented in the starter project.
You will add the code to persist and query data.*

. Download the link:{attachmentsdir}/starter-project.zip[starter project].
. Unzip *starter-project.zip*.
. Open the *starter-project/HotelFinder/* directory in the JavaScript editor of your choice (for example, https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code] or https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/[WebStorm]).
. The User Interface code is located in *ui/Bookmarks.js* and *ui/Search.js*.
. Run the following commands in your Terminal.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd HotelFinder
npm install -g react-native-cli
npm install
react-native link
----
The `react-native link` command bundles native dependencies in your Android project.
It is required in the https://react-native-training.github.io/react-native-elements/docs/0.19.0/getting_started.html[react-native-elements] installation process.
. Start the React Native development server.
+
[source,bash]
----
npm run start
----
The `npm run start` command starts a web server that bundles and serves the JavaScript code to the application.
You should see the following in the output.
+
[source,bash]
----
Metro Bundler ready.

Loading dependency graph...
----
. Open the Android Studio project at *HotelFinder/android/build.gradle*.
. Build and run.
If you run the app on SDK 23 or above you will be prompted to allow the "Display over other apps" permission the first time the app is installed.
Make sure to allow this permission and run the app again from Android Studio.
It allows React Native to overlay the status when downloading a new bundle from the dev server.
This permission is only required during development so end users wouldn't perform these steps in a production build of the application.
+
image::overlay-permissions.png[]
. You can click on the *Hotels* button to run a search query.
The result of the query will be empty.

In the next section, you will setup the Native Module interface which is the first step for establishing communication between native code and JavaScript.

== Native Modules Setup

With https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-modules-android[Native Modules], you can write native code and have access to it from JavaScript.
It is helpful when an app needs access to native APIs, and React Native doesn't have a corresponding module yet.
In this tutorial, you will use the Native Modules API to implement methods in Java and call them from the JavaScript code.
These methods will do the following:

- Full Text Search for terms in a Couchbase Lite database.
- Query documents in a Couchbase Lite database.
- Create and Update documents in a Couchbase Lite database.

=== Java Setup

. Create a new file named *HotelFinderNative.java* in *app/src/main/java/com/hotelfinder/* .This file will contain the native implementation of the methods that will be exported to JS. Insert the following class definition.
+
[source,java]
----
public class HotelFinderNative extends ReactContextBaseJavaModule {

    HotelFinderNative(ReactApplicationContext reactContext) {
        super(reactContext);
    }

    @Override
    public String getName() {
        return "HotelFinderNative";
    }

}
----
. Create a new file named *HotelFinderPackage.java* in *app/src/main/java/com/hotelfinder/* with the following.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/{hotel-finder-package}[tag=hotel-finder-package,indent=0]
----
This code subclasses the `ReactPackage` class and is required by React Native.
Packages can contain multiple modules which is useful if you wish to separate the native logic into separate modules.
In this example, there is only one module to register, `HotelFinderNative`.
. Next, you must register the package in React Native's `getPackages` method.
Open *MainApplication.java* and  update the `getPackages` method to also include `HotelFinderPackage` in the list that is returned.
+
[source,java]
----
protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
  return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
    new VectorIconsPackage(),
    new HotelFinderPackage() // <-- Add this line with your package name.
  );
}
----

You are now ready to implement functionalities in Java.
The next step is to import the Couchbase Lite framework in your project.

== Couchbase Lite Setup

. Add the following in the `dependencies` section of the applicationâ€™s *build.gradle* (the one in the *app* folder).
+
[source,java]
----
implementation 'com.couchbase.lite:couchbase-lite-android:2.1.0'
----

== Database Setup

In our example, we will start with a pre-built Couchbase Lite database that contains a bunch of hotel documents.
We will make our queries against the documents in this database.
Note that in a real world application, the data could be synced down from other Couchbase Lite clients or from Sync Gateway in the cloud.

The pre-built database needs to be added to the Android Studio project.

. Download link:{attachmentsdir}/travel-sample.cblite2.zip[travel-sample.cblite2.zip] and drag it over to *android/app/src/main/assets/*.
. You will use the singleton pattern to setup the database instance.
Create a new file named *DatabaseManager.java* and insert the following.
+
In this code, you first check if a database named "travel-sample" exists.
If it doesn't exist, the bundled database file is copied to the default Couchbase Lite directory.
The database is then opened and the instance is set.
The `createIndex` method creates the Full-Text Search index on the `description` property.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/{database-manager}[tag=setup-database,indent=0]
----
. Next, add the following properties in *HotelFinderNative.java*.
+
[source,java]
----
private static String DOC_TYPE = "bookmarkedhotels";
private Database database;
----
. Finally, update the `HotelFinderNative` class initializer to include code to initialize the database.
+
[source,java]
----
HotelFinderNative(ReactApplicationContext reactContext) {
  super(reactContext);
  DatabaseManager.getSharedInstance(reactContext);
  this.database = DatabaseManager.getDatabase();
}
----
This code adds the database as an instance property on the `HotelFinderNative` class.
. Build the project. Confirm that it builds successfully.

In the next sections, you will use this instance variable to perform various operations.

== Search Hotels

In this section, you will add the functionality to search for hotels.

. First, we import the appropriate ReactNative module. For this, add the following to the top of *HotelFinder/ui/Search.js*.
+
[source,javascript]
----
include::{examplesdir}/HotelFinder/ui/Search.js[tag=import,indent=0]
----
The `HotelFinderNative` constant corresponds to the native module that was created in the <<java-setup,Java Setup>> section.
. Next, you must implement a method in the `HotelFinderNative` module before it can be accessed in JavaScript.
Implement this method in *HotelFinderNative.java*.
+
This code creates the Full-Text search query using the `match()` operator.
+
In this particular example, the match expression looks for the `descriptionText` value in the `description` property.
This match expression is logically ANDed with an `equalTo` comparison expression which looks for the `locationText` value in the `country`, `city`, `state` or `address` properties.This expression is then used in the `where` clause of the query in the usual way.
+
The `ReactMethod` annotation is used to mark methods that are exposed to React Native.
Note that on iOS, we use a xref::ios.adoc#native-modules-setup[header file] for method signatures.
To do the same on Android, you could declare an interface to list all signatures and have the `HotelFinderNative` class implement methods from the interface.
In this tutorial however, you will implement the methods directly in *HotelFinderNative.java*.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/{hotel-finder-native}[tag=search,indent=0]
----
. You can call the `search` swift method from *Search.js*. For this, add the following text to the `onChangeText` method in *Search.js*.

+
[source,javascript]
----
include::{examplesdir}/HotelFinder/ui/Search.js[tag=search,indent=0]
----
. Build & run. You may see a number of "Cannot find symbol class" error. Be sure to import the relevant packages.
. Tap on "Hotels" button to get to the "Search" screen.
. In search screen. enter "UK" in the _Country_ input field and press the *Lookup* button.
You should now see a list of hotels in the search result.
+
image::android_search.gif[,350px]

== Bookmark Hotel

. Bookmarked hotel IDs are persisted in a separate document of type `bookmarkedhotels`.
+
The first time a hotel is bookmarked, the `bookmarkedhotels` document is created.
Subsequently, every time a new hotel is bookmarked, the hotel ID is appended to the `hotels` array of the existing document.
You will add a method to find or create the document of type `bookmarkedhotels`.
Add the following `findOrCreateBookmarkDocument` method in *HotelFinderNative.java*.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/{hotel-finder-native}[tag=find-or-create,indent=0]
----
. You will now add the method to update the `bookmarkedhotels` document every time a hotel is bookmarked.
+
Implement the `bookmark` method in *HotelFinderNative.java*.
Every time a new hotel is bookmarked, the hotel ID is appended to the `hotels` array and the update is saved to the database.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/{hotel-finder-native}[tag=bookmark,indent=0]
----
. You can now call it from *Search.js*. Add the following to the `bookmark` method in *Search.js*.
+
[source,javascript]
----
include::{examplesdir}/HotelFinder/ui/Search.js[tag=bookmark,indent=0]
----
. While searching for hotels, the app should also display an icon on hotels that are previously bookmarked .
To do so, you will add a new method to query hotel Ids.
Implement the corresponding method natively in *HotelFinderNative.java*.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/{hotel-finder-native}[tag=query-ids,indent=0]
----
. . You can now call `queryBookmarkIds` java method from *Search.js*. For that, add the following to the `componentWillMount` method in *Search.js*
+
[source,javascript]
----
include::{examplesdir}/HotelFinder/ui/Search.js[tag=query-ids,indent=0]
----
. Build & run.
. Click *Hotels* and search for a hotel (type "United States" in the country field for example).
. You can now swipe a table view row to bookmark a hotel.
The bookmark icon is displayed.
+
image::android_swipe.gif[,350px]

In the next section, you will query the bookmarked hotels to display them on the _Bookmarks_ screen.

== List Bookmarks

. Insert a new method called `queryBookmarkDocuments` in *HotelFinderNative.java*.
+
[source,java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/{hotel-finder-native}[tag=query-bookmarks,indent=0]
----
To query bookmark documents, you will write a JOIN query between the document of type `bookmarkedhotels` which contains hotel Ids and documents of type `hotels` which contain all the other fields (`name`, `address`, `phone` etc.)

. On the JavaScript side, you must first import the `HotelFinderNative` ReactNative module.
Add the following to the top of *HotelFinder/ui/Bookmarks.js*.
+
[source,javascript]
----
include::{examplesdir}/HotelFinder/ui/Bookmarks.js[tag=import,indent=0]
----
. You can now call the `queryBookmarkDocuments` native method from *Bookmarks.js*. Add the following text to the `queryBookmarkDocuments` method in *Bookmarks.js*.
+
[source,javascript]
----
include::{examplesdir}/HotelFinder/ui/Bookmarks.js[tag=query-bookmarks,indent=0]
----
. Build and run.
. You should now see the hotel that was bookmarked in the <<bookmark-hotel, Bookmark Hotel>> section listed in the _bookmarks_ screen
+
image::android_home_screen.png[,350px]

By now, the pattern should seem very familiar and essentially consists of the following steps:

- Implement the method natively in *HotelFinderNative.java*.
This layer will interact with the native Android Java implementation of Couchbase Lite for data persistence functions.
- Invoke the exported method from JavaScript (you will have to import the React Native module the very first time).

== Conclusion

*Well done!* You have learned how to import Couchbase Lite in a React Native project, and how to add search and persistence functionalities to your application!

As an exercise, you can follow the same procedure to implement the functionality to:

- Unbookmark a hotel on the Bookmarks screen.
- Unbookmark a hotel on the Search screen.

You can find a working copy of the *completed project* in the link:{attachmentsdir}/final-project.zip[final project] zip file.
The final project also implements the missing functionalities mentioned above.
